# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
Create an app with input statements to filter the data for travelerâ€™s weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

### Resources
